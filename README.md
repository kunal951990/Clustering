Clustering is Unsupervised Learning

#Overview
When Clustering algorithms is used on dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings.

##Dependencies

Anaconda (https://anaconda.org/) Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) numpy (pip install numpy) sklearn (pip install sklearn) Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, we can use classification to predict a unpredicted categories in form of clusters.
